# TuffyTravel Milestone 2

This is milestone 2 of the [TuffyTravel Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1ZAH-vt8ih500WFyDb_j5PO2L3_XS4_3CswPRJ5qNE/edit?usp=sharing).

# Requirements
Design a `Route` class that will store the *name_*, *departure_time_* and *arrival_time_* for a route. For example, a `Route` object might contain the route name *57 Brea Mall - State College-Nutwood*, a *departure time* of 9:45am and *arrival time* of 9:56am. Please use the previously mentioned member variable names and their corresponding accessors and mutators to ensure your program will pass the unit test.

Create a function called *create_route* that asks the user to provide the name of the route, the departure time, and the arrival time. This function does not receive any inputs, but returns a `Route` object containing the information that the user entered.

Modify your Milestone 1 program so that it calls the *create_route* function to create three `Route` objects. Use the accessors of each `Route` object to figure out which one will allow the passenger to leave by the time they specified. When displaying the information about the best route, your program should now show the best route's *name*, *departure time*, and *arrival time*.

The code should be organized so that class and function prototypes are placed in a header file (`route.hpp`) while their implementations are placed in a source file (`route.cpp`). Finally, the *main* method should be in the driver file (`tuffytravel.cpp`).

Please see the sample output below to guide the design of your program.

# Sample output
<pre>
Welcome to TuffyTravel!

Route 1:
Please enter the name of the route: <b>57x Brea Mall Xpress</b>
Please enter the departure time of the route: <b>1623</b>
Please enter the arrival time of the route: <b>1637</b>

Route 2:
Please enter the name of the route: <b>153 Brea Mall</b>
Please enter the departure time of the route: <b>1642</b>
Please enter the arrival time of the route: <b>1703</b>

Route 3:
Please enter the name of the route: <b>57x Brea Mall Xpress</b>
Please enter the departure time of the route: <b>1648</b>
Please enter the arrival time of the route: <b>1702</b>

Please enter the time you wish to leave: <b>1630</b>

You should probably take the 153 Brea Mall that leaves at 1642 and arrives at 1703 which fits your preferred time to leave, 1630.

# Submission checklist
1. Created function prototype.
1. Created function implementation.
1. Called functions in the driver accordingly.
1. Followed the [proper file structure for using functions](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/function-file-organization)
1. Compiled and ran the driver (`tuffytravel`).
1. Manually checked for compilation and logical errors.
1. Designed and tested your own test cases.
1. Ensured no errors on the unit test (`make test`).
1. Ensured no errors on the style check (`make stylecheck`).
1. Ensured no errors on the format check (`make formatcheck`).
1. Completed reflection file ([reflection.md](reflection.md))

# Code evaluation
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains this exercise. Assuming you have pulled the code inside of `/home/student/ms01-tuffy` and you are currently in `/home/student` you can issue the following commands

```
cd ms01-tuffy
```

Use the `clang++` command to compile your code and the `./` command to run it. The sample code below shows how you would compile code save in `tuffytravel.cpp` and into the executable file `tuffytravel`. Make sure you use the correct filenames required in this problem.  Take note that if you make any changes to your code, you will need to compile it first before you see changes when running it.

```
clang++ -std=c++17 tuffytravel.cpp route.cpp -o tuffytravel
./tuffytravel
```

You can run one, two, or all the commands below to `test` your code, `stylecheck` your code's design, or `formatcheck` your work. Kindly make sure that you have compiled and executed your code before issuing any of the commands below to avoid errors.

```
make test
make stylecheck
make formatcheck
```

A faster way of running all these tests uses the `all` parameter.

```
make all
```

# Submission
1. When everything runs correctly,  let's copy your code into the Github repository. The first step is to add your code to what is called the staging area using git's `add` command. The parameter after `add` is the name of the file you want to add. There are cases when you have multiple changed files, so you can just type . (period) to add all modified files.

    ```
    git add .
    ```
1. Once everything is in the staging area, we use the `commit` command to tell git that we have added everything we need into the staging area.

    ```
    git commit
    ```
1. In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github username.

    ```
    git config --global user.email "tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Tuffy Titan"
    ```
    When you're done, make sure you type `git commit` again.    
1. Git will ask you to describe what you have added to the staging area. By default, you will use a command-line based editor called *nano*. Go ahead and provide a description then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm that you want to make changes and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Lets push all changes to the Github repository using git's `push` command. Provide your Github username and password when you are asked.

    ```
    git push
    ```
1. When you finish the exercise, go back into github.com through the browser interface and ensure all your files have been correctly updated.
